Title:
    Drawing Objects and Figures Using C (BGI Graphics)

Objectives
    - To learn how to draw complex objects using basic graphics primitives.
    - To combine lines, circles, ellipses, and arcs to create figures.
    - To practice coordinate placement and visualization in graphics.
    - To understand how BGI graphics can be used to design simple illustrations.

Theory
    BGI Graphics: A graphics library in Turbo C/C++ for creating 2D graphics.

    Primitives used:

        - line(x1,y1,x2,y2) – draws straight lines.
        - circle(x,y,r) – draws circles
        - ellipse(xc,yc,start_angle,end_angle,rx,ry) – draws ellipses or arcs.
        - arc(xc,yc,start_angle,end_angle,r) – draws arcs of a circle.
        -  outtextxy(x,y,"text") – displays text at a specific position.

    Combining primitives: Multiple lines, circles, and ellipses can be combined to form figures like houses, objects, or stick figures.


Discussion

   - Figures are created by combining     simple primitives.
    - Placement of coordinates is crucial for making the figure look correct.
    - Using BGI graphics helps visualize how shapes are drawn in pixel-based coordinates.
    - Delays or color changes can improve clarity and visual appeal.


Conclusion

    - Successfully implemented various 2D objects and figures using BGI graphics.
    - Learned how to use lines, circles, ellipses, and arcs to create complex figures.
